# Competitive Coding Leaderboard

Welcome to the **Competitive Coding Leaderboard** â€“ a platform designed to fairly rank users across different coding websites, regardless of their preferred platform.

ðŸ”— [Check it out here](https://competitive-coding-leaderboard.vercel.app)

## Purpose

The goal is to create a unified space where users can compare their performance and activity across platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, and **GitHub**. Each platform has unique metrics for evaluation:

- **LeetCode**: Total problems solved.
- **Codeforces**: Contest rating.
- **CodeChef**: Rating and stars.
- **GitHub**: Public repositories showcasing contributions.

To make this comparison even more insightful, a **statistical leaderboard** has been integrated, providing a visual representation of rankings and scores.

## Why Is This Useful?

1. **Unified Comparison**: No need to switch between platforms to gauge your progressâ€”compare all in one place.
2. **Cross-Platform Insights**: See how your competitive coding journey stacks up across various platforms.
3. **Motivation**: Healthy competition can inspire you to improve and stay consistent.

## Tagline

**Compare platforms and score their performance.**

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! Future enhancements include:
- Expanding the functionality by adding more platforms and metrics.
- Improving the user experience.
- Adding deeper insights into your performance trends.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [website](https://competitive-coding-leaderboard.vercel.app).
2. Enter your username from any supported platform (LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, or GitHub).
3. View your rank and compare your performance across platforms.

## Get Involved

Feel free to fork the project, raise issues, and contribute to making this leaderboard even better! If you'd like to collaborate or provide feedback, I'd love to hear from you.
